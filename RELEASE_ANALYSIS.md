# Release & Publish Automation Analysis

## Current State

The merobox repository has automated release and publish workflows, but they're currently **NOT triggering** due to missing Makefile targets.

## Workflow Triggers

### 1. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- ‚úÖ Push tags matching `v*` pattern (e.g., `v0.1.27`)
- ‚úÖ Manual workflow dispatch with version input

**What it does:**
- Builds binaries for multiple platforms (macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64)
- Creates GitHub release with binaries
- Generates release notes automatically

**Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING** - Creates GitHub releases when tags are pushed

**Last successful release:** `v0.1.24` (based on existing tags)

---

### 2. Publish Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- üî¥ When a GitHub release is **published** (not just created)
- Depends on the release workflow completing

**What it does:**
- Runs `make check` (lint + test)
- Runs `make publish` to publish to PyPI
- Runs `make test-publish` to publish to TestPyPI

**Status:** üî¥ **FAILING** - Missing Makefile targets

**Problem:**
```bash
# These targets are missing from Makefile:
make build         # Build Python package
make check         # Exists but calls 'make test' which may not exist
make publish       # Publish to PyPI
make test-publish  # Publish to TestPyPI
```

---

### 3. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `master` branch
- Pull requests to `master` branch

**What it does:**
- Format checking with black
- Integration tests
- Merobox CLI testing

**Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING**

---

## Root Cause

The Makefile **used to have** publish targets (commit `8d2321a`), but they were **removed** in a later commit. The workflow still references these targets.

### Missing Makefile Targets:

```makefile
build: clean ## Build the package
	python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

test-publish: check ## Test publish to TestPyPI
	twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

publish: check ## Publish to PyPI (requires confirmation)
	@echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Are you sure you want to publish to PyPI?"
	@read -p "Type 'yes' to confirm: " confirm; \
	if [ "$$confirm" = "yes" ]; then \
		twine upload dist/*; \
		echo "‚úÖ Package published to PyPI!"; \
	else \
		echo "‚ùå Publish cancelled."; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
```

---

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Restore Makefile Targets (Recommended)

Add the missing targets back to `Makefile`:

```makefile
build: clean ## Build the package
	python -m build

check: ## Build and validate package
	python -m build
	twine check dist/*

test-publish: ## Publish to TestPyPI
	twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

publish: ## Publish to PyPI
	twine upload dist/*
```

**Note:** Updated to use `python -m build` (modern standard) instead of `setup.py` (deprecated)

### Option 2: Update Workflow to Not Use Make

Update `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to run commands directly:

```yaml
- name: Build package
  run: python -m build

- name: Check package
  run: twine check dist/*

- name: Publish to PyPI
  run: twine upload dist/*
```

## How the Process Works Now

### Complete Release Flow (100% AUTOMATED):

```
1. Update version in:
   - pyproject.toml
   - merobox/__init__.py
   
   Example:
   version = "0.1.28"  (in pyproject.toml)
   __version__ = "0.1.28"  (in merobox/__init__.py)

2. Commit and push to master:
   git add pyproject.toml merobox/__init__.py
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.28"
   git push origin master

3. üéâ GitHub Actions automatically does EVERYTHING:
   
   a. Auto-tag workflow triggers (on push to master)
      ‚úì Detects version bump in pyproject.toml
      ‚úì Verifies versions match in __init__.py
      ‚úì Creates tag vX.Y.Z automatically
      ‚úì Pushes tag to GitHub
      ‚úì Comments on commit with status
   
   b. Release workflow triggers (on tag creation)
      ‚úì Builds binaries for all platforms (macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64)
      ‚úì Generates checksums (SHA256)
      ‚úì Creates GitHub release with binaries
      ‚úì Generates release notes automatically
      ‚úì PUBLISHES the release immediately (not draft)
   
   c. Publish workflow triggers (on release published)
      ‚úì Builds Python package (sdist + wheel)
      ‚úì Validates package with twine
      ‚úì Publishes to PyPI automatically
      ‚úì Publishes to TestPyPI (if token exists)
   
   d. Done! üéä
      ‚úì GitHub release is live with binaries
      ‚úì Package is on PyPI
      ‚úì Users can install via: pip install merobox
      ‚úì Users can download binaries from GitHub releases
```

### Zero Manual Steps Required!

Just bump the version and push to master. Everything else is automatic. You can monitor progress in the Actions tab.

### Workflow Chain:

```
Version Bump Commit ‚Üí Auto-Tag ‚Üí Release Build ‚Üí Publish to PyPI
       (you)         (automated)   (automated)      (automated)
```

## Current vs Expected Behavior

### Before This Fix:
1. ‚úÖ Tag pushed ‚Üí Release workflow runs ‚Üí Binaries built
2. ‚úÖ GitHub release created as **DRAFT**
3. ‚ùå Manual step: Publish the draft release
4. üî¥ **Publish workflow fails** ‚Üí `make publish` not found
5. ‚ùå Manual step: Build and publish to PyPI locally

### After This Fix (FULLY AUTOMATED):
1. ‚úÖ Tag pushed ‚Üí Release workflow runs ‚Üí Binaries built
2. ‚úÖ GitHub release **PUBLISHED** automatically
3. ‚úÖ Publish workflow triggers ‚Üí Package published to PyPI
4. üéâ **Done!** No manual steps required!

## Unified Workflow (Recommended)

We've created a **single unified workflow** (`release-unified.yml`) that handles everything:

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Single workflow to maintain instead of 3 separate ones
- ‚úÖ Better job dependencies and error handling
- ‚úÖ Clearer execution flow
- ‚úÖ Automatic retry and rollback capabilities
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for the release process

### Workflow Jobs:

1. **auto-tag** - Detects version bumps and creates tags
2. **build-binaries** - Builds executables for all platforms
3. **create-release** - Creates and publishes GitHub release
4. **publish-pypi** - Publishes package to PyPI
5. **notify-completion** - Reports final status

### Migration Plan:

**Option A: Use Unified Workflow (Recommended)**
1. Enable `release-unified.yml`
2. Disable old workflows:
   - Rename `.github/workflows/release.yml` to `release.yml.disabled`
   - Rename `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to `publish.yml.disabled`
   - Rename `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` to `auto-tag.yml.disabled`

**Option B: Keep Separate Workflows**
1. Use the fixes in `release.yml`, `publish.yml`, and `auto-tag.yml`
2. Keep workflows separate for granular control

### Required Secrets:

Ensure these are configured in GitHub repository settings:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - PyPI token (required)
- `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` - TestPyPI token (optional)

### Test the Flow:

```bash
# 1. Update version
# Edit pyproject.toml and merobox/__init__.py

# 2. Commit and push
git add pyproject.toml merobox/__init__.py
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.28"
git push origin master

# 3. Watch the magic happen
# Monitor: https://github.com/calimero-network/merobox/actions

## Why Manual Releases Are Currently Required

You've been manually publishing to PyPI because:
1. The automated publish workflow is **broken** (missing Makefile targets)
2. You have to run the build/publish steps locally instead
3. This is why you had to:
   - `mv build.py build.py.bak`
   - `python -m build`
   - `python -m twine upload dist/*`

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the Makefile** - Add back the missing targets
2. **Update workflows** to use modern `python -m build` instead of `setup.py`
3. **Document the process** in CONTRIBUTING.md
4. **Automate version bumping** - Consider using tools like `bump2version`
5. **Add pre-publish checks** - Version validation, changelog updates, etc.
